  * see your photos on a Google Map, as in iPhoto [screencast](http://seriot.ch/software/desktop/CocoaSlideShow/screencasts/google_map.mov)
  * edit the metadata and find them with Spotlight [screencast](http://seriot.ch/software/desktop/CocoaSlideShow/screencasts/spotlight.mov)
  * export lightweight JPEG thumbnails, say for Facebook upload [screencast](http://seriot.ch/software/desktop/CocoaSlideShow/screencasts/resize_images.mov)
  * export KML files to Google Maps or Google Earth [screencast](http://seriot.ch/software/desktop/CocoaSlideShow/screencasts/export_kml.mov)

_I really liked the simplicity of CocoaSlideShow. It's refreshing to use a straightforward, elegant photo viewer that does exactly what it's supposed to with no fuss._ [-Nick Mead, Softonic](http://cocoaslideshow.en.softonic.com/mac)
